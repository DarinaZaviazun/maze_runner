A Java program that reads an image file of a maze and traces the solution.

To run the program, convert content of the folder to a runnable JAR file.
Then, run the JAR with a suitable maze image in the same directory as the JAR.
The JAR creates a new image file of the solved maze in the same directory as the JAR.

$ java -jar mazeRunner-1.0.jar maze1.png

Requirements for images:
cell size = 14px x 14px
line width = 2px
entrance is on the top
exit is on the bottom

The most challenging part for developer was reading, writing and modifying image. Also some difficulties occurred while
creating class that will characterize one cell of a maze and how a movement will be implemented.
